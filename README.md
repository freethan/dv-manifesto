#Developer Manifesto
> Thoughts on how to live a productive life being a developer
---

#Demand clear objectives
>You can only deliver the best of you, when you know what it is about.

#Think first, code later
>Spend considerably more time analyzing the problems at hand and then get your hands dirty.

#Embrace, debate, optimize
>As workflows and approaches to problem-solving change rapidly, have an open mind to something new but do put it under a microscope before fully diving in. Optimize these processes and approaches when possible and give feedback.

#Prototype and explore
>Not all tools are made for all jobs. Prototyping and exploring new ways to approach problems, allows you to compare tools and test concepts before they reach production. Why buy a Ferrari when all you need is a [Lada Niva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lada_Niva) ?

#Iterate
Taken from [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/):
>First do it, then do it right, then do it better.

#When given a choice, code slower and with an "extensible" base in mind, rather than coding fast and then tearing it down.
>When applicable, take the time to add some extensibility hooks and defensively code for the future rather than coding "quick and dirty" for the **NOW and HERE**. 

    Experience shows that even if you can be fast in developing a solution, you spend considerably more time when asked to alter it.

#Test test test
>Provide as many as possible testing fixtures for the code / solutions you provide.

    Testing allows you and people not familiar with the project to contribute and optimize while testing a deliverable's expected behaviour.

#Ask and answer the why and the how
>There is no `holy` approach or workflow. Even if the team has accepted and is working well with such structures, things are always open to well-intended critique, concept evolution and better alternatives.

#Choose a workflow for committing and sharing code
>As important as it is to manage versions of your source code, it is equally important to evolve it in a parallel fashion.

    e.g. Producing a feature while at the same time creating a patch for an already live version of the source code.

#Document
>Document your code and deliverables â€“ You are not alone and you will probably will not remember in 6 months time.

#Edit yourself
>Keep some things for the next iteration cycle. Learn to prioritize what is more important in delivering a Minimum Viable Product.

#Review and get reviewed
>Friends don't let friends ship without a review.

#Stage often
>Put your deliverables to test in near-production environments. Avoid surprises on the "big day".

#Deploy early
>The more often you put your deliverables out there, the more chances you have to get feedback and proceed with the next iteration.

#Fail fast
>Failure is not a problem if there are lessons learned. The next iteration should incorporate those lessons and make you a better man.

#Be Honest
>Express yourself. Don't be shy. But be polite.

#Don't be afraid to ask
>No man or woman is left behind

#Automate
>How many tentacles shall we grow today Sir? Automation will try to remove the day-to-day burden of repeating, trivial (or not so trivial) tasks that need 0 to little human interaction.
